# Algorithmic play

Territories which are not managed by players will have to be managed algorithmically. Essentially, the algorithm may choose any [party](Political_Parties.html) for any territory, but there will be strong biases both in the probability and the stability of party associations with territories. 

The following associations will be made.

| Territory    | Initial party                       | Stability                                    |
