# Algorithmic play

Territories which are not managed by players will have to be managed algorithmically. Essentially, the algorithm may choose any party for any territory, but there will be strong biases both in the probability and the stability of party associations with territories. 

The following associations will be made.

| Territory    | Initial party | Stability    |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ |
| America      | Blue          | Volatile     |
| Africa       | Red           | Volatile     |
| Brazil       | Blue          | Volatile     |
| China        | Red           | Stable       |
| Europe       | Red           | Intermediate |
| India        | Blue          | Intermediate |
| Russia       | Blue          | Volatile     |
| Saudi Arabia | Blue          | Volatile     |
