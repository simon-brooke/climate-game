# Influencing other territories

Broadly you can influence other territories by three main methods (and algorithmically managed territories will use these too).

## Diplomacy

What this fundamentally comes down to is bribing territories into doing what you want. It will cost money, probably serious money. You can also donate aid or send rescuers to a catastrophic event in another player's territory, which will also be recognised by algorithmic players as a friendly gesture (this will probably be cheaper in the long run). Diplomacy has no carbon cost, and no real downside. Poorer territories will generally be cheaper to buy than richer ones, red territories will generally be cheaper to buy than blue or green ones.

## Interference

You can interfere in another territory's political processes by bribing politicians, funding favoured political parties, or buying media. This needs to be covert or it will be greatly resented; there is a random but significant chance of it backfiring spectacularly (i.e. promoting the faction you oppose rather than the one you support). It will generally be cheaper than diplomacy but has no carbon cost.

## Military intervention

You can attempt to impose the government you want on a territory by military intervention. Military intervention will only work if the attacking territory is at least equally militarily strong as the defending. Other territories of the same political colour may join in to support the territory attacked.

Military intervention has huge carbon cost, and a war involving both America and China, or any four territories, is essentially game over everyone loses.
